I'd like to say:  
An electronic chip website can have tens of millions of entries, and you can't manually import them one by one. Most of the time, a typical backend wouldn't be able to handle this amount of data. For example, a WordPress backend wouldn't be able to handle 12 million IC records.  

Secondly, I recommend a VPS server â€” I recommend [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com). Purchases from the official website are currently **15% off**.  

You can check out these classic electronic chip purchasing sites:  
- [Jinxinyang Tech](https://www.szjxy-ic.com/)  
- [PCB Inquiry](https://www.pcbinq.com/)  
- [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/)  
- [Mouser Electronics](https://www.mouser.com/)  
- [Joydo Electronics](https://www.joydo-ele.com/)
